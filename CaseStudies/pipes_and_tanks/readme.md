# Pipes and Tanks
![Alt text](img\pipes_n_tanks.png?raw=true "pipes and tanks")

This is meant to be both a tutorial on digital twins, as well as a starter template for your own digital twin. The focus is on simulation and process flow. It should be able to use the 3dScene Explorer. 

## 3D Scenes
You'll need a `.gtlf` file. I made mine in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) using templates from the thingaverse. Steve Snow](https://www.thingiverse.com/snowman77/designs) for the pipe and tank objects on thingaverse.
